Photograph: AppleApple iPad (9th Gen, 2021) Tablet for $270 ($60 off)AmazonTargetBest Buy (Expired)Even though Apple added a 10th-generation iPad to the lineup last month, it's too expensive for an entry-level iPad. The ninth-generation tablet (8/10, WIRED Recommends) remains the best iPad for most people. Not only is it affordable, especially with this discount, but it also packs a 12-MP camera with support for Center Stage to keep you in the frame during video calls. There's a physical Touch ID-enabled Home Button (for those who prefer it), a True Tone display that adjusts the screen's color temperature depending on the lighting around you, and 64 GB of storage. Apple iPad Mini (2021, 6th Gen) Tablet for $400 ($60 off)The iPad Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) makes an excellent travel companion. It's small enough to slip into my tote or backpack, and the 8.3-inch display is great for reading ebooks or watching movies. Equipped with an A15 Bionic processor (the same one powering last year's iPhone 13), it's fast enough to handle both taxing apps and games. With second-generation Apple Pencil support, you can also use it as a notebook or sketchpad. It's dipped to this price before, but it's still a solid deal.iPad Pro and Apple Pencil
Photograph: Apple Apple iPad Pro (12.9-inch, 5th Gen, 256 GB) Tablet for $900 ($300 off)This is last year's iPad Pro model with the M1 processor. The new sixth-generation iPad Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) that debuted last month is also on sale for $999 ($100 off), but the updates are so incremental you should save your cash and just snag the 2021 version instead. Use the $100 you save to buy the second-gen Apple Pencil ($89).Apple Pencil (2nd Generation) Stylus for $89 ($40 off)The Apple Pencil is one of the most useful tools you can add to the iPad. You'll want to make sure your iPad supports the second-generation model (see our iPad Accessories guide), but it's excellent for drawing and for navigating iPadOS, which has handwriting support in various search fields so you don't need to switch to the keyboard to type.MacBook DealsRead our Best MacBook guide for more.Apple MacBook Air M2
Photograph: AppleApple MacBook Air (M2, 2022) Laptop for $1,049 ($150 off)Apple introduced a new design with its latest MacBook Air (7/10, WIRED Recommends), which is also powered by the new M2 chipset. It has plenty of power for most everyday tasks, solid battery life, and a 1080p webcam. You also get a MagSafe connector so the laptop won't fly off if you trip on the cable. It's pricier than its predecessor, but this discount helps remedy that. Just remember that the chipset doesn't let you connect this machine to more than one external display. Apple MacBook Air (M1, 2020) Laptop for $799 ($200 off)AmazonBest Buy (Expired)Even though the M1-powered MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) came out in 2020, it's still one of the most powerful laptops you can buy for this price. And it's our favorite budget MacBook to recommend. It has great performance, battery life (it'll easily last you a full workday), and an improved keyboard (that won't break). It's also slim and lightweight, which makes it great for travel. Apple MacBook Pro
Photograph: AppleApple MacBook Pro (14 Inch, M1 Pro) Laptop for $1,600 ($399 off)AmazonBest BuyThe 14-inch MacBook Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) from 2021 comes with a variety of upgrades. On the outside, it has a boxier chassis, plenty of ports (including a MagSafe charging port), a 1080p webcam, and a stunning 14.2-inch display with ProMotion (which has a frame rate of 120 Hz). The M1 Pro under the hood offers excellent performance and can handle almost any demanding project you toss at it. (It's confusing, but the M1 Pro is more powerful than the M2.)Apple MacBook Pro (16 Inch, M1 Pro) Laptop for $1,599 ($600 off)Best Buy ($600 off)Amazon ($200 off)With the 16-inch MacBook Pro (512 GB), you'll get the same features as the 14-inch model. But since it's massive, it's not the easiest MacBook to travel with and barely fits in most of my tote bags or backpacks. Regardless, the extra screen real estate is awesome, especially if you spend most of your work days staring at a computer while on the go. This model frequently dips to this price, but this is still a solid deal.Apple MacBook Pro (16 Inch, M1 Max) Laptop for $3,100 ($200 off)This is the MacBook for anyone that needs the most power they can get from an Apple laptop thanks to the M1 Max. It's paired with 32 GB of RAM and a terabyte of storage. This is plenty if you need to edit 4K video on the go, render 3D art, or do just about anything intensive from the luxury of a coffee shop.Jump to a Topic: iPads, MacBooks, Apple Watches, AirPods, Beats, Accessories, Cases, Apple Gift Card DealsApple Watch and TV DealsCheck out our Best Apple Watch guide to learn more about each model.Apple Watch Series 8
Photograph: AppleApple Watch Series 8 (41 mm, GPS) Smartwatch for $350 ($50 off)AmazonTarget ($380)WalmartThe Apple Watch (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Apple Watch in the lineup. In addition to a blood oxygen level sensor, ECG reader, and heart rate monitor, Apple also introduced a wrist-based temperature sensing feature that tracks your skin temperature. This can be super useful for tracking your period and fertility. It also comes with Crash Detection, which uses two new motion sensors, a high G-force accelerometer, and an improved gyroscope to detect when you've been in a severe car crash and connect you to emergency services.Apple Watch Series 7 (45 mm) for $310 ($120 off)The Series 7 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) offers nearly the same experience as the Series 8. The only big differences are that the Series 7 doesn't have crash detection or a skin temperature sensor. If you don't care about those features, or you have a bigger wrist, this may be a better fit. Only select colors are on sale. Apple Watch SE (41 mm, 2nd-Gen, GPS) for $229 ($20 off)AmazonTarget ($230)Best BuyWe recommend the second-generation Apple Watch SE to most people—especially if you don't need the complex capabilities of the Series 8 like the ECG sensor, temperature sensor, or the ability to check your blood oxygen. But it's more than capable of tracking your health and fitness and, with the latest S8 chip, you'll also get Crash Detection and the redesigned compass app. It's compatible with WatchOS 9 too, which means you won't miss out on any of the latest software features. Apple Watch Ultra
Photograph: AppleApple Watch Ultra Smartwatch for $739 ($60 off)AmazonBest BuyThis is the first discount we've seen on Apple's luxury smartwatch (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It's meant for folks that tend to take on more extreme outdoorsy activities. It has the best battery life you'll find on an Apple Watch mostly because it's much bigger than the standard Apple Watch and can accommodate a bigger battery. There's a loud siren in case you're lost in the woods, and a spare Action Button to trigger specific and configurable actions.Apple TV HD (32 GB, 2nd-Gen) for $59 ($40 off)This model doesn't support 4K TVs like the newest Apple TV. But if you don't have a 4K TV, this is the way to go, especially at this price.AirPod and Beats DealsFor more audio recommendations, read our Best Wireless Earbuds guide.Apple AirPods Pro
Photograph: AppleApple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen, 2022) Wireless Earbuds for $200 ($50 off)AmazonTargetBest BuyThe second-gen AirPods Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) come with upgrades like improved noise canceling and better battery life—you'll get six hours with the buds and 24 hours in the case, which will certainly get you through a full workday. The charging case also comes with new features like the ability to sync it with Apple's Find My app (which will emit a beeping sound to help you locate them), and the option to charge it on an Apple Watch puck. Read our Best Wireless Earbuds guide for more. Apple AirPods (2nd Gen) for $79 ($20 off)—Not a Top PickThe AirPods Pro above are the better choice, but if you don't want to spend $200, these are actually discounted for once. We think they're OK, not great. Check out our Best Cheap Headphones guide for better options.Beats Fit Pro Wireless Earbuds for $160 ($40 off)AmazonTargetWalmartApple owns Beats, and WIRED associate editor Parker Hall says these are his favorite Apple-made headphones to recommend to most people (9/10, WIRED Recommends). They're extremely comfortable, sound great, and pair seamlessly with all your Apple devices (just like standard AirPods). They also come in many colors and look a lot more stylish than Apple's own earbuds. These are especially great for workouts as they have earfins to better stay in your ears. Beats Powerbeats Pro
Photograph: BeatsBeats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds for $150 ($50 off)TargetWalmartStill worried about your earbuds falling out? The Powerbeats Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) offer an even more secure fit that will stay put. These also sound better than Apple's standard AirPods and get nine hours of battery life from a single charge. They'll automatically pause your music or move a call back to your phone when your take one out of your ear. Read our Best Wireless Earbuds for Working Out guide for more recommendations.Beats Flex Wireless Earbuds for $40 ($30 off)TargetAmazonWalmartIf you have a tendency to misplace your earbuds (we're all guilty of it), these neckband earbuds are an ideal option. Rather than always having to store them when you take them out of your ears, you can just let them dangle loose. The Beats Flex pair quickly with iPhones complete with access to Siri. They also have long 12-hour battery life and charge via USB-C, so they'll work great with Android devices too.Beats Studio3 Over-Ear Wireless Headphones for $150 ($80 off)The Studio3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are a bit old at this point, but they're still a great pair of over-ear headphones that are also really comfortable. Other notable features are great noise cancellation, excellent Bluetooth range, and instant pairing with Apple devices. Android users, on the other hand, might experience worse battery life, but they'll still be able to connect via Bluetooth just fine.Apple AccessoriesWe've got plenty more accessory recommendations in our Best Apple 3-in-1 Wireless Chargers, Best Wireless Chargers, and Best MagSafe Accessories guides.MagSafe Charger
Photograph: AppleApple MagSafe Wireless Charger for $30 ($10 off)AmazonTargetWalmart ($23)There are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there, but Apple's official charger will power up your iPhone the quickest (15 watts) because it aligns precisely with the spot that allows for the best power transfer. But with an annoyingly short 3-foot cable, it's tough to use your phone while it's charging unless you're right next to where it's plugged in.Belkin MagSafe 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Stand for $80 ($20 off)TargetAmazonIt's a shame that the 3-in-1 stand isn't on sale, as that's our favorite 3-in-1 charging station for Apple fans. Still, this 2-in-1 stand is good if you only have an iPhone and AirPods to charge. It looks stylish, holds your MagSafe iPhone securely in portrait or landscape orientation, and charges up to 15 watts.Apple MagSafe Duo Wireless Charger for $97 ($32 off)AmazonTargetBest Buy ($129)The MagSafe Duo is a great choice if you have both an iPhone and an Apple Watch, with respective spots for both. It folds in half too, which makes it really easy to travel with. It's just far too expensive for what it does, but this deal makes it a bit more stomachable. Satechi 3-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charging Stand for $90 ($30 off)—Use Code BFCM25Satechi's 3-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charging Stand is compact, but accommodates everything you need. You can squeeze in your Apple Watch at the back, wireless earbuds at the front of the base, and the iPhone can float on the stand nearby in portrait or landscape orientation.Anker 637 MagGo 8-in-1 Wireless Charger.
Anker 637 Wireless Charger for $70 ($30 off)—Prime Members Only; Click the CouponThis deal requires Amazon Prime, but if you're a subscriber you can score a good deal on one of our favorite MagSafe desktop chargers. The front of the orb is where you can stick your iPhone to wirelessly charge it, but on the back are two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and three AC outlets. It makes managing all those pesky cables under the desk so much easier. Satechi 108-Watt USB-C 3-Port Charger for $56 ($19 off)—Use Code BFCM25This Satechi wall charger can power up three USB-C devices up to 108 watts. That's plenty of power to charge your 16-inch MacBook Pro and iPad Air at the same time.Apple Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro 12.9-inch for $299 ($50 off)If not for its price tag, this would be one of the better iPad case and keyboard options. It feels great to type on, the trackpad integrates seamlessly into iPadOS, and it even has a USB-C port. This deal takes a little of the pain out of the price. It's compatible with a few generations of the iPad Pro 12.9-inch model, including the latest 6th gen. Apple Smart Keyboard Folio for iPad Pro and iPad Air for $149 ($21 off)AmazonBest BuyApple's Smart Folio Keyboard isn't our favorite keyboard case—especially if you prefer springy feedback—but it is silent. It's one of the thinnest keyboard covers out there. Since it uses Apple's Smart Connector, it doesn't require pairing or charging either. This one is compatible with the 11-inch iPad Pro (2nd, 3rd, and 4th generation) and iPad Air (4th and 5th generation).Satechi Aluminum Stand
Photograph: SatechiSatechi Aluminum Desktop Stand for $34 ($11 off)—Use Code BFCM25If you prefer a dedicated stand to a folio case, this is the one we recommend. The rubber base prevents it from sliding easily, and there are two hinges to tweak the height and viewing angle of the tablet. It's lightweight enough that you can even travel with it.Logitech Combo Touch Keyboard Cover for iPad for $130 ($18 off)AmazonBest BuyThis is our favorite keyboard case in our roundup of Best iPad accessories. It comes with a built-in keyboard, trackpad, and kickstand. You can also detach the keyboard when you don't need it, and simply use the kickstand—which comes in handy when you're using your iPad to watch movies. It connects via Apple's Smart Connector too, which means you don't need to worry about pairing it via Bluetooth or worry about charging it. This one is compatible with the past three basic iPads (not the 10th-gen iPad). Other versions for different iPads are also on sale.Satechi 2-in-1 Headphone Stand With Wireless Charging for $60 ($20 off)This multipurpose gadget made our list of the Best MagSafe Accessories. This headphone stand will keep your over-ears up and off your desk, and the base doubles as a MagSafe wireless charging pad for your phone or earbuds. Just make sure you have a power adapter around since unfortunately, you need to supply your own. Anker 623 MagGo 2-in-1 Wireless Charger
Photograph: AnkerAnker 623 MagGo 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Dock for $60 ($20 off)Anker's compact cylinder-shaped charger has a phone platform that flips up, allowing you to snap your phone in place. There's room to charge your AirPods too. In the box, you'll also get a cable and adapter. We also like this Anker wireless power bank, which is also on sale for $60 ($20 off). It comes with a built-in kickstand.iOttie Velox MagSafe Wireless Charging Car Mount for $40 ($10 off)There's nothing more frustrating than when your phone constantly falls off the charging mount if the ride gets even slightly bumpy. You don't have to worry about that with iOttie's Velox charging mount. We've been using it for more than a year now and it has yet to fall off even once. It's easy to set up too, just install it right onto your air vent.Courant Mag:1 Classics MagSafe Wireless Charger for $60 ($20 off)The Courant Mag:1 charger is certainly on the luxurious side—complete with Italian leather and matte aluminum. It also comes with a really nice 6-foot braided cord. However, despite Courant's claims on its website, it's important to note this charger will recharge your iPhone at 7.5 watts (not 15 watts).BackBone One
Photograph: BackboneBackbone One iPhone Controller for $75 ($25 off)TargetBest Buy ($75)Amazon (Expired)If you spend a lot of time playing mobile games on your iPhone, the Backbone One (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is an excellent accessory. Simply plug the Lightning connector into the phone, stretch the controller over it, and you're all set. It also comes with support for Xbox Remote Play, Steam Link, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, PS Remote Play, and GeForce Now. This deal was slightly better over the weekend, but if you missed it, it's still a good buy at this price.Nimble PowerKnit USB-C and Lightning Cables for $15 ($12 off)These cables support 60-watt charging, and they're made from recycled plastic and aluminum. They also last forever, even with heavy use. The cable design keeps everything together so you won't end up with internal fraying or an awkwardly bent port. PopSockets Phone Accessories: 20 Percent off Most of us are familiar with PopSockets phone grips and mounts. They might change your life. Save on MagSafe mounts and more of the company's famous grips. Casetify Wallet
Photograph: CasetifyCasetify MagSafe Wallets: 30 Percent off—Use Code CM2022There are lots of MagSafe wallets to choose from, but this is one of our faves. Oodles of colors and customization options are available, and your cards will stay both protected and accessible. The only downside is that you'll have to choose just two cards to carry. Cable Matters USB-C Cable for $23 ($8 off)—Prime Members OnlyThis Intel-certified Thunderbolt 4 cable is one of the best you can buy. It can carry up to 100 watts, can transfer data at up to 40 Gbps, and can serve an 8K display (or two 4K displays). The affordable price is the icing on the cake. Anker 623 MagGo 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Stand for $96 ($24 off)Then there's the Anker 623 magnetic wireless charger. This dock looks a bit like a flask, but the top “lid” has a hinge, allowing it to be angled out. That's where you place your iPhone to recharge it wirelessly, and you can adjust the angle so it sits upright. In this position, you can plop your AirPods behind the iPhone to recharge them wirelessly at the same time. It's one of our favorites.Nomad Base Station Charger for $105 ($45 off)Nomad's Base Station charging pad will charge your Apple Accessories that feature wireless or Magsafe charging, and it can also charge your watch which is a nice additional feature. The watch charger itself being an odd shape is usually left out of charging docks like these, so it's nice to see a place to drop all your gadgets at the end of the day that can get them ready for the next. Apple Cases and BandsRead our Best Apple Watch Accessories, Best iPhone 14 Cases, and Best iPad Accessories guides for more.Apple Silicone Case with MagSafe (iPhone 14). 
Photograph: AppleApple Silicone Case with MagSafe (iPhone 14) for $37 ($12 off)AmazonTargetApple's official MagSafe case has clicky buttons, accurate cutouts for ports, and the entire bottom edge of the phone is protected too. The case also comes in a variety of colors, although only certain ones are on sale depending on whether you're shopping for the iPhone 14, 14 Plus, or 14 Pro. It can be a magnet for lint and dust though. Nimble MagSafe Disc Case for iPhone 14 Series for $34 ($11 off)This is the best clear case for the iPhone 14 series. It feels great, not weirdly sticky like some clear cases, and it's made of recycled discs (yes, compact discs!). It still offers MagSafe support, hence the white ring on the back, which means you'll be able to attach MagSafe accessories with no problem. Need a screen protector? We also love Nimble's Sustain Glass Screen Protector, which is also on sale for $22 ($8 off).OtterBox: 25 Percent off SitewideOtterBox makes great cases for iPhone, iPad, and other Apple gear. As one example, the Antimicrobial Band is one of our favorite Apple Watch accessories. It's less expensive than the official Apple silicone band, and it comes in more colors. Today it's on sale for $22 ($8 off). Case-Mate Blox iPhone 14 Case.
Photograph: Case-MateCase-Mate Blox iPhone 14 MagSafe Case for $14 ($16 off)AmazonTarget ($15)These bright, fun phone cases will ensure you never get your phone mixed up with someone else's. We like the bold shape and the accurate cutouts. The buttons are also nice. MagSafe support rounds out another good, affordable case. Society6 iPhone Cases for $10 ($15 off)Society6 snap-on cases are cute and cheap. There's a huge range of designs available for iPhones 6 and newer. Each design is from an independent artist. Zugu iPad Pro Case. 
Photograph: Zugu★ Zugu Case for iPads: 30 Percent off SitewideZugu's iPad cases are our top pick in our iPad accessories guide. This case feels durable, with a rigid bumper around the edges, and the buttons are easy to press. There's a sizable lip sticking out of the edges to protect the screen if it falls flat, which is nice. The cover is magnetized so it stays shut (and can wake or put the screen to sleep). Proatl Jelly Band for Apple Watch for $8 ($1 off)I absolutely love this Apple Watch accessory. It transforms my smartwatch into an accessory straight out of the ‘90s. It’s comfortable, affordable, and even cheaper than usual. There are tons of colors to choose from—I'm partial to Turquoise. OtterBox Symmetry iPhone 14 Pro MagSafe Case for $37 ($12 off)We like OtterBox cases, and the Symmetry range is a little slimmer than the Defender series, but it doesn't sacrifice too much in terms of protection. There are raised edges, buttons feel satisfying to push, and you can access all your iPhone's features.Totallee Thin iPhone Cases for $20 ($19 off)Amazon ($39)WalmartThese iPhone cases from Totallee don't offer the most protection, but they're some of the thinnest out there. So, while it won't protect your phone from damage if you drop it, it'll at least keep your phone safe from everyday scuffs without adding much bulk. It's available for a variety of iPhone models.Apple Store Gift Card DealsBetween November 25 and November 28, you'll get a gift card when you purchase certain Apple products from the Apple Store in person, online, or through the app. The value of the gift card will depend on the specific gadget, but we've rounded up the best offers below.
